# Expense Splitter App Development Plan

## Tasks
- [x] Rewrite expense/src/App.jsx to implement the full expense splitter functionality (participants management, expense addition, balance calculation)
- [x] Overhaul expense/src/App.css for a professional, attractive UI with soothing colors (soft blues, greens, neutrals) and modern design
- [x] Test the app by running it locally to ensure functionality and responsiveness
